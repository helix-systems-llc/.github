## Who We Are

Helix Systems builds digital tools that serve their intended purpose excellently while respecting your fundamental rights to privacy, security, and data autonomy.

We reject the false choice between functionality and privacy. Every product we create is designed with **privacy by design** and **security as foundation**—not as afterthoughts, but as core architectural principles.

## Our Principles

- **🔒 Privacy by Design** – We collect the absolute minimum data necessary. You're our customer, not our product.
- **🛡️ Security as Foundation** – From zero-knowledge architectures to end-to-end encryption, security is the bedrock of everything we build.
- **🔍 Radical Transparency** – Our methods are open to scrutiny. We communicate clearly about what we collect (and what we don't).
- **🌍 Accessible Excellence** – Privacy shouldn't be a luxury. Core features remain free and accessible to everyone.
- **✨ Simplicity Without Compromise** – Secure doesn't mean complicated. Our tools are designed for humans.

## Products

### 🟣 [BalancePoint](https://github.com/helix-systems/balancepoint)
Privacy-first financial management and debt optimization. Manual CSV import, zero-knowledge architecture, and complete user control over your financial data.

*No predatory bank aggregators. No third-party data sharing. No tracking. Just your finances, managed your way.*

### 🔗 [AnonLink](https://github.com/helix-systems/anonlink)
Anonymous link shortening with zero user tracking. No IP logging, no behavioral analytics, optional auto-expiring links.

*Share links, not data.*

## Our Approach to Open Source

We practice **selective transparency**—open sourcing privacy-critical components while protecting intellectual property that enables us to build sustainable products.

**What we open source:**
- Cryptographic libraries and security implementations
- Privacy-preserving architectures and protocols
- Client-side encryption and zero-knowledge systems
- Documentation of our security models

**What we keep proprietary:**
- Business logic and competitive algorithms
- Anti-abuse and spam prevention systems
- Infrastructure optimizations

We believe this balanced approach proves our privacy claims through verifiable code while maintaining the business sustainability needed to keep building privacy-respecting tools.

## What We Never Do

❌ Sell, rent, or share your data with third parties  
↪ In most cases we don't even have your data to share.  
❌ Track you across the web  
❌ Use dark patterns to manipulate consent  
❌ Compromise security for convenience  
❌ Implement features that benefit us at your expense  

## What We Always Do

✅ Be transparent about our data practices  
✅ Provide robust functionality in free tiers  
✅ Regularly audit and improve security measures  
✅ Listen to and respect user feedback  
✅ Choose the harder path if it better protects your privacy
